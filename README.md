# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is a project done as part of The Odin Project course curriculum. It's a simple pixel art painting canvas with a cute pastel color palette.

The objective of the Odin exercise was to create a simple resizable grid hovering over which would leave a trail of colored cells behind the cursor. I decided to expand a bit on the project and give it some extra polish. :)
